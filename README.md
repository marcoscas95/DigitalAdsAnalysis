# Digital Marketing Analysis

Nowadays, a lot of data is received whenever a digital marketing campaign is created (impressions, clicks, users, bounce rate, etc.). However, many companies still do not know how much to spend on Digital Marketing, the marketing channels to focus on, and the amount of conversions they should expect depending on a specific budget. Therefore, if we could analyze all different marketing campaigns in order to know which ones are the ones that perform the best and how many conversions we could expect, companies could improve their decision making. 

## Industry Importance

All companies should invest in marketing in order to let their audience (or market) know they exist. Digital Marketing, different from traditional marketing (mainly TV and Radio) provides all kinds of data that could be analyzed in order to have an idea on what to expect and make better decisions. If a company could know how many conversions they could expect for every amount in dollars spent in marketing, it could be easier for them to make better budget allocations, choose the right marketing channels to find the right customers for them and increase overall sales for the business which would lead to growth.
